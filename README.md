##Purpose:

A TI style graphing calculator with powers including math, graphs, and TI BASIC.

##Log:

######First Objective: Basic arithmatic. 
We may be using straight java and displaying in processing using Swing for the graphing functions later.

########Initial Tasks:
Window: creating a simple GUI display with buttons, interpreting input
Evaluation: evaluation of simple math functions
            currently working on implementing order of operations (excluding parentheses)
            next step will be to implement evaluating with parentheses and those math functions that require them (log,              sin, etc)
