##Purpose:

A TI style graphing calculator with powers including math, graphs, and TI BASIC.

##DevLog:

**2015-01-05:**<br>
K and M both worked on basic arithmetic evaluation using order of operations for +, -, *, and /.
Two different approaches were implemented, in Parse.java and Arithmetic.java, respectively.

**2015-01-06:**<br>
K started the GUI; M created an order of operations ArrayList.

**2015-01-07:**<br>
M worked on evaluation with parentheses; works in some cases but bugs in others.
K fixed aforementioned bugs as well as subsequent bugs that arose from the first bug fix.

**2015-01-08:**<br>
M moved Evaluation.java code into a processing file and began work on the Processing display.
K used the *power* of recursion to simplify evaluation of String expressions, and made the order of operations more *power*ful.

######First Objective: Basic arithmatic. 
~~We may be using straight java and displaying in processing using Swing for the graphing functions later.~~
This is now full-on Processing

######Initial Tasks:
Window:
creating a simple GUI display with buttons, interpreting input

Evaluation:
evaluation of simple math functions
