==============
##Purpose:

A TI style graphing calculator with powers including math, graphs, and TI BASIC.

##DevLog:

**2015-01-05:**<br>
K and M both worked on basic arithmetic evaluation using order of operations for +, -, *, and /.
Two different approaches were implemented, in Parse.java and Arithmetic.java, respectively.

**2015-01-06:**<br>




######First Objective: Basic arithmatic. 
We may be using straight java and displaying in processing using Swing for the graphing functions later.

######Initial Tasks:
Window:
creating a simple GUI display with buttons, interpreting input

Evaluation:
evaluation of simple math functions

currently working on implementing order of operations (excluding parentheses)
            
next step will be to implement evaluating with parentheses and those math functions that require them (log, sin, etc)
